My name is Елена Вознюк. I have the following semi-rad qualities, though one is not true:

- My parents hit the lottery but want all the kids to be independent and that's why I'm in grad school instead of on a yacht.
- I have met the entire Obama family; got a hug from Barack and Michelle.
- At the age of 29 I survived cardiac arrest when enzymes from the liver got to my heart.

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
