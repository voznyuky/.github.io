My name is Елена Вознюк. Some semi-rad things about me:

- My left shoulder is double jointed and I can lock and twist my arms around my entire body.
- I have met the entire Obama family; got a hug from Barack and Michelle.
- At the age of 29 I survived going into cardiac arrest.
- I was born in a country that doesn't exist anymore; USSR.
